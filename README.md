# WS-Practice-with-Jersey-CEJA

## About the project
This project is part of the practices developed during the Advanced Java Extension Course, affectionately CEJA, to type less :sweat_smile:. 
In this practice, we understand a little more about the [Jersey-docs](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/index.html)
framework configuration and how to make GET requests, with and without parameters, and POST in the creation and search of books.
